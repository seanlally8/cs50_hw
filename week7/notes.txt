relational databases
    Micr. Access, Oracle, SQL server,
        implemented in software
            allow us to insert data, search data much more efficiently than in a flatfile (csv)

with relational data, SQL, used in conjunction with other programming language
    python can use SQL to do more powerful things than python
        SQLite is a more user friendly than SQL, used by our iphones and other hardware
            SQL is the basis of most other relational database software (Oracle, Access, etc)

We can query data with SQL

Now, all our data is in a binary file (0s and 1s), 
    to interact with this binary file, we need a tool (sqlite3, a cli tool) to interact with the tables (in the binary file)
        you can import a csv into the database
