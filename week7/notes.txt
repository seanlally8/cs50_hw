relational databases
    Micr. Access, Oracle, SQL server,
        implemented in software
            allow us to insert data, search data much more efficiently than in a flatfile (csv)

with relational data, SQL, used in conjunction with other programming language
    python can use SQL to do more powerful things than python
        SQLite is a more user friendly than SQL, used by our iphones and other hardware
            SQL is the basis of most other relational database software (Oracle, Access, etc)

We can query data with SQL

Now, all our data is in a binary file (0s and 1s), 
    to interact with this binary file, we need a tool (sqlite3, a cli tool) to interact with the tables (in the binary file)
        you can import a csv into the database
    
CRUD -- general operations used in relational databases

Create
Read
Update
Delete

in sqlite this translates to:

Create, or Insert
    i.e. CREATE TABLE table (<- name of table)
Select
    i.e. you can select a particular column from table
Update
Delete


    
Data types in sqlite
    Blob, int, numeric, real, text
            Numeric -> number like but not int, date time etc
            blob -> large binary object
    
SQL -> when we create columns manually, we can say a column cannot be NULL, 
            And we can use Unique to say whatever values are in colum must be unique (can't double up emails for instance)

Primary keys and foreign keys
    two tables
            Shows
                ID (Primary Key) uniquely identifies each row
                Title  
            
            Genres
                show ID (Foreign Key) refers to primary key
                Genre
            
            
            example
            
            Table 1
            The Office (connected to row with ID #003)
            
            Table 2
            Comedy (connected to row with #003)
            Drama (Connected to row with #003)
            
in sqlite you can nest queries
    SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN( nested query) to get the title associated with given show
    
We can add a third table that contains all the relevant ids that point to their corresponding rows in corresponding table
