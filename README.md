These are all my notes and assignments (some finished, some in process) for Harvard's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">cs50x</a>, taught by David Malan. I'm maintaining this repository to practice git commands and workflows, with reference to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git book</a> by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.
